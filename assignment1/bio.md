Hello, my name is Jana. I work as a reliability technician at SolarWorld in Hillsboro, OR.

Outside of work and school time, I enjoy spending time with my kids, cooking, gardening, and crafting.

I have three boys and two rabbits who keep me busy.

Programming Background

My programming background is mainly what has been covered so far in this program, with the exception to HTML.
I learned HTML when I was first in college years ago. In this program, I've learned C++ and assembly, and worked with C.
So far I think my favorite class has been assembly language.

I'm looking forward to learning web development.
My son would like me to teach him as well.
